## INTRODUCTION
Your home value is based on what willing buyers in the market will pay for your home, but every buyer is different. For instance, some people might consider factors like the number of story building, numbers bathrooms, the furnishing status, and or the location from the main-road.

These questions are:

1. Does the furnishing status contribute to the price of a house?								
2. What is the impact of the number of bathrooms on the housing price?								
3. Does number of bedroom affect the price of the house?
4. Does basement in a house affects the price of the house?								
5. Do houses located near the mainroad sell at a higher price than the rest?
